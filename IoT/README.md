# River IoT - smart fuzzing for the Internet of Things

This a subproject of [River framework](https://river.cs.unibuc.ro) developing various fuzzing and formal methods for testing the security of Internet of Things.

## Our team

The research teams collaborating in the project are from the University of Bucharest (team lead: Alin Stefanescu) and Politehnica University of Bucharest (team lead: Razvan Deaconescu).

All the team members: [Alin Stefanescu](http://alin.stefanescu.eu), [Razvan Deaconescu](https://cs.pub.ro/index.php/people/userprofile/razvan_deaconescu), Ciprian Paduraru, Rares Cristea, Eduard Staniloiu, Bogdan Ghimis, Andreia Ocanoaia

## Project

Project objectives are twofold: 
- to develop beyond-state-of-the-art methods for software security assessment for IoT systems and
- to create a platform for evaluating smart home interconnected applications.

The main outcome will be an open-source software solution to test IoT (Internet-of-Things) applications in general, with a focus on smart home systems.

## Future plans

- benchmark for IoT testing
- release of the first version of the platform in October 2021 
- test the platform on several use cases from the industry
