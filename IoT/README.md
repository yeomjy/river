## Project

Project objectives are twofold: 
- to create a platform for evaluating smart home interconnected applications and 
- to develop beyond-state-of-the-art methods for software security assessment for IoT systems

The main outcome will be an open-source software solution to test IoT (Internet-of-Things) applications in general, with a focus on smart home systems.
